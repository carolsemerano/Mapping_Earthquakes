# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview

This analysis aims to present data from Earthquakes using Javascript, GeoJSON, and Leaflet.

## Summary

There are two options of background available - Streets and Satellite.
Four layers were created:
- Earthquakes: Shows all earthquakes in the past week. Circle markers varies in colour and size, according to magnitude.
- Tectonic Plates: Creates a layer with the boundaries of tectonic plates. This layer allows to compare the location of each plate and the earquakes.
- Major Earthquakes: Highlights earthquakes with magnitude of 4.5 or higher in the past week.
- Past Hour Earthquakes: Adds markers in the locations where erquakes happened in the past hour.
